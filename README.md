This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior when using ByRef parameters in VBScript functions. The issue arises when modifying a numeric variable passed by reference; the change is not reflected outside of the function's scope in some cases, contrary to expectations. The bug.vbs file illustrates the problem, and bugSolution.vbs provides a workaround using a return value.  The core issue highlights potential misunderstandings around ByRef in VBScript's function parameter handling.
